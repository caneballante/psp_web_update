				<p><strong>Dear Partner in Puget Sound Recovery,</strong></p>
				<p>Preregistration for Near Term Actions (NTA) to be included in the 2018–2022 Action Agenda is now closed.  <strong>More than 800 NTA preregistrations were received by the December 22 deadline!</strong> Thank you to everyone who preregistered, and for your continued support for Puget Sound recovery. <strong></strong><br>
				Information about the preregistered NTAs is now publically available on the Partnership&rsquo;s website through a <a href="http://www.psp.wa.gov/2018_AA_preregistrations.php">searchable database, downloadable spreadsheet</a>, and <a href="http://www.psp.wa.gov/2018_AA_preregistration_map.php">online map</a>. A diversity of organizations preregistered NTAs, including federal, state, local, and tribal government agencies; non-governmental organizations; academic institutions; foundations; and private businesses. Most of the Regional Priorities outlined in <a href="http://www.psp.wa.gov/2018_AA_solicitation_for_NTAs.php">the NTA Solicitation</a> are represented in the NTAs, as are all regions of Puget Sound. <br>
				Now that preregistration is complete, NTA managers should be working on completing NTA Fact Sheets, which are due no later than March 30, 2018. Use the online Fact Sheet tool to make sure all required information is included in the final submission.  In addition, please refer to <a href="http://www.psp.wa.gov/2018_AA_solicitation_for_NTAs.php">the Solicitation</a> for specific deadlines related to the review processes of Local Integrating Organizations (LIOs). Those NTAs proposed for implementation in one or two LIO geographies must be reviewed by the applicable LIOs. The deadline for submitting a complete draft of the NTA Fact Sheet to LIOs is February 6, 2018. <br>
				All information in the online NTA Fact Sheet tool is considered draft until the March 30, 2018 deadline. Draft and final Fact Sheets are viewable by the Partnership, LIO coordinators and Strategic Initiative Leads.<br>
				NTA Fact Sheets will be considered final <em>once the submission process is complete, no later than </em><strong>the March 30, 2018 </strong>deadline. The NTA manager may continue to edit and modify the NTA Fact Sheet until the deadline, but it cannot be changed after that. <br>
				<strong>Questions?</strong><br>
				If you require accommodations to access any material, or if you have questions about submitting an NTA Fact Sheet, please contact Jennifer Pouliotte by email at <a href="mailto:jennifer.pouliotte@psp.wa.gov">action.agenda@psp.wa.gov</a> or by phone at 360-522-0545.  <br>

				<h3>Updated Schedule for the Solicitation of Near Term Actions and Adoption of 2018-2022 Puget Sound Action Agenda </h3>

				<p>The Puget Sound Partnership heard from partners that the original timeline for the release of the Solicitation for Near Term Actions for the 2018-2022 Action Agenda did not allow adequate time for quality work and discussion. In response to these concerns, we have extended the timeline, and associated deadlines, for the solicitation. The new schedule provides more time for quality work and collaboration, which will enable us to collectively make successful progress toward our Puget Sound recovery goals. Details of the new schedule are outlined below.</p>

				<ol>
					<li>The&nbsp;<strong>Solicitation</strong>&nbsp;for      Near Term Actions for the 2018-2022 Action Agenda is expected be released in&nbsp;<strong>mid-November 2017</strong>. The solicitation will include deadlines and will provide detail on the NTA development and review process.</li>
					<li>The period for&nbsp;<strong>NTA development</strong>&nbsp;will occur between&nbsp;<strong>mid-November 2017 and the end of March 2018.      Pre-registration</strong>&nbsp;for      all NTAs will be due on&nbsp;<strong>December 22, 2017</strong>.</li>
					<li>The period of&nbsp;<strong>NTA review</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>will occur between&nbsp;<strong>April and July 2018.</strong></li>
					<li>The period of&nbsp;<strong>Action Agenda development</strong>, review, public comment, and revision will occur between&nbsp;<strong>April and December of 2018</strong>.</li>
					<li>The&nbsp;<strong>2018-2022 Action Agenda</strong>&nbsp;is anticipated to be adopted and published in&nbsp;<strong>December 2018</strong>.</li>
				</ol>
			
				<p>We are dedicated to continually improving the Action Agenda and to building strong partnerships so that we can collectively and successfully make progress towards our Puget Sound recovery goals. We are confident that these adjustments are an important step toward building an Action Agenda that better addresses all of our needs and is responsive to partner input.</p><p>
