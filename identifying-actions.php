			<h2>Overall vision, scope, and timeline for the 2022-2026 Action Agenda update</h2>

<p>The 2022-2026 Action Agenda will be an update to the Puget Sound recovery plan for protected habitat, thriving species, and healthy people. The purpose of the 2022-2026 Action Agenda is to concentrate our efforts, energy, and investments on key transformational changes that will enable us to collectively advance progress toward the statutory goals and Vital Signs that guide Puget Sound recovery. In June 2020, the Leadership Council adopted a concept and schedule for updating the 2022-2026 Action Agenda. The approved schedule includes multiple phases of work.</p><br>
			<img class="img-responsive" src="https://pspwa.box.com/shared/static/uoeewhy6v4831exjd3uufd86pv21dszy.png" width="1491" height="421" alt=""/>

<br><p>Phase 2 focused on identifying science-informed <a href="https://pspwa.box.com/s/lwk71kpaaoo9off1iw5ancj3m7xrcp45" target="_blank">desired recovery outcomes</a> that describe what we intend to accomplish to advance Puget Sound recovery. Phase 3 focused on identifying the strategies necessary to make progress toward the Action Agenda desired outcomes, the <a href="https://vitalsigns.pugetsoundinfo.wa.gov/" target="_blank">Puget Sound Vital Signs</a>, and <a href="https://psp.wa.gov/puget-sound-recovery.php">statutory goals</a>. In phase 4—the second to last phase of the 2022-2026 Action Agenda update process—we will identify the actions to advance strategies.</p>
			
			<h2>Actions describe the activities that are a shared focus for implementing strategies </h2>
			<p>For the purposes of the 2022-2026 Action Agenda update, an action describes the activities that will be a shared focus for implementing each strategy from 2022-2026. This could include restoration and acquisition program development, improvement, or implementation; education; outreach; research; legislative or policy improvements; or other types of activities. Actions are intended to guide partner implementation and innovation and will inform the focus of public and private funding and implementation support by the boards and regional partners. </p>
			
			<h2>How will Action Agenda actions be identified?  </h2>
			<p>The phase 4 process is designed to promote co-generation of Action Agenda actions that will implement strategies. Actions will be identified through public workshops and will utilize <a href="https://psp.wa.gov/implementation-strategies.php">Implementation Strategies</a> and other existing plans<sup>1</sup>  – as well as approved desired outcomes and approved strategies – as a starting point for discussion. Public workshops will take place between early November and mid-December. Each workshop will be approximately two to three hours in length and will be held virtually: </p>
			
			<div class="highlightbox margin-0-top margin-0-bottom"><p><sup>1</sup><a href="https://psp.wa.gov/LIO-overview.php">Local Integrating Organization (LIO) plans</a>, <a href="https://nwtreatytribes.org/habitatstrategy/" target="_blank">tribal priorities</a>, <a href="https://psp.wa.gov/salmon-recovery-overview.php">salmon recovery plans</a>, and <a href="https://www.governor.wa.gov/issues/issues/energy-environment/southern-resident-orca-recovery/task-force" target="_blank">the Orca Task Force recommendations</a> also provide important activities and policy recommendations for the Action Agenda and reveal areas of shared focus where actions will advance multiple aspects of recovery. These plans are all created through science-informed and collaborative processes that capture the expertise and most recent thinking of individuals from around the region. Through the process of reviewing and providing feedback on the initial draft list of actions via public workshops, partner and board meetings, recovery partners will have the opportunity to identify additional actions that are needed implement strategies. </p></div><br>

All workshops will consider institutional strategies such as funding, leadership, research, and education. During the workshops, facilitators will ask participants to identify actions that will best to achieve intended near-term results and overcome key barriers for strategies as well as achieve desired outcomes. Participants will receive background materials in advance of each workshop in order to prepare for the discussions. Participation in the workshops is highly encouraged and will provide an opportunity from partners from across the recovery come together to co-generate actions to advance Puget Sound recovery. Following the public workshops, results will be synthesized into proposed actions for board review and adoption in early 2022. </p>

		<p>Members of the recovery community will have two main ways to participate in phase 4:</p>
			<ol>
			<li>Join a public workshop on action identification in November and early December. </li>
				<li>Join one of the Partnership's regularly scheduled board meetings and provide public comments (see the <a href="https://psp.wa.gov/partnership-boards-overview.php">Puget Sound Partnership Board’s webpage for more information).</a></li>
