        				&quot;Personal information&quot; is information about a natural person that is readily identifiable to that specific individual. Personal information includes such things as an individual's name, address, and phone number. A domain name or Internet Protocol address is not considered personal information. </p>

However, this information is a public record once you provide it, and may be subject to public inspection and copying if not protected by federal or state law.</p>
        		<p class="text">Users are cautioned that the collection of personal information requested from or volunteered by children on-line or by email will be treated the same as information given by an adult, and may be subject to public access.
