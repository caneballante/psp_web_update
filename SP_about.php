		John Stein is the former Science and Research Director of NOAA Fisheries' Northwest Fisheries Science Center in Seattle, WA, and is currently Scientist Emeritus with NOAA Fisheries. The Center&rsquo;s scientific responsibilities are for living marine resources (e.g., salmon, groundfish, and killer whales) and their habitats of the Pacific Northwest (e.g., salmon) and along the west coast (e.g., groundfish). The improved understanding of these resources and their ecosystems is used to support resource managers in making sound decisions that build sustainable fisheries, recover endangered and threatened species, and sustain healthy ecosystems and coastal economies. He has authored over 75 publications and is an affiliate faculty member in the University of Washington&rsquo;s School of Aquatic and Fisheries Sciences, and is currently the Vice-Chair of PICES (North Pacific Marine Science Organization) a multinational organization of Pacific Rim countries. At NOAA, in addition to his duties as Science Center Director he co-directed NOAA Fisheries California Current Integrated Ecosystem Assessment with the director of the SW Fisheries Science, was the federal co-lead for Marine Planning on the west coast under the National Ocean Policy, and the lead for NOAA's Seafood Safety Program in response to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.</p>

		Eddy Kennedy’s research experience over the past 17 years has had a strong focus on aquaculture and coastal management issues.  For seven years ending in 2016, he managed a research section in DFO’s Maritimes Region on the east coast of Canada with a focus on coastal habitat ecology and the potential impacts of human pressures on marine ecosystem components.  In his current role as Division Manager for the Ecosystem Science Division, Fisheries and Oceans Canada in the Pacific Region, which he started in October 2016, he is responsible for managing research and monitoring activities that enhance knowledge on the structure and function of aquatic ecosystems (including Strait of Georgia) and that support improved understanding of the impacts of stressors on ecosystem components as well as options to mitigate or manage such impacts.   The various research programs, which span the marine and freshwater environments, aim to incorporate ecosystem considerations into decision making.  These programs include mitigating risks to the recovery of the Southern Resident Killer Whales, understanding ecosystem conditions that impact wild salmon populations, enhancing marine conservation planning, mitigating potential impacts of aquaculture, aquatic invasive species, and characterizing ecosystem baselines upon which management decisions can be made to mitigate potential stressors and to maintain ecosystem structure, function, and resilience.
