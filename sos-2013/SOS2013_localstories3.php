				<p>The Olympic Peninsula’s Elwha River once had one of the richest salmon runs in the Pacific Northwest. Six species of Pacific salmon (Chinook, chum, coho, pink, sockeye, and steelhead) and other anadromous fish (species that migrate from fresh water to salt water and back again to reproduce) spawned in the Elwha by the tens of thousands each year—until two dams built in the early 1900s blocked access to all but the lowest five miles of the river.</p>
				<p>Thanks to the largest dam removal project in U.S. history, the Elwha River will soon flow freely from its headwaters in the Olympic Mountains to the Strait of Juan de Fuca, giving salmon access to over 70 miles of river and tributary habitats for the first time in nearly 100 years.</p>

				<h3>The Elwha Act</h3>
				
				<p>The Elwha River watershed is one of the best locations for ecosystem restoration in the continental United States. More than 80% of this important watershed is located within the protected boundaries of the Olympic National Park and consists of high quality, mostly [or almost entirely] pristine habitat. Returning the entire Elwha River to a more natural state will restore one of the largest watersheds on the Olympic Peninsula and provide significant long-term benefits for Puget Sound recovery.</p>
				<p>Recognizing the importance of the Elwha River watershed, the U.S. Congress passed the Elwha River Ecosystem and Fisheries Restoration Act (The Elwha Act) in 1992. Its goal is ambitious: the full restoration of the Elwha River ecosystem and native anadromous fisheries. </p>
				<p>Although the lower river has been impacted by historical floodplain logging and channelization, and the Elwha nearshore is degraded, there was only one major habitat impediment impacting natural ecosystem processes: the dams. Lesser habitat impacts include lower river levees and stream bank armoring. Removing the dams will immediately reestablish fish access to the upper watershed and, over time, improve river, estuarine, and nearshore habitat quality. It will also restore natural ecosystem processes, including sediment and wood transport, channel formation and function, nutrient cycling, and thermal regimes.</p>
<p>
				<h3>Accomplishments</h3>
				</p>
				<p>Two Elwha River restoration milestones were met in 2012: the complete removal of Elwha Dam and the partial removal of Glines Canyon Dam. Elwha Dam removal was completed by September 2012 (concrete gravity portion by March 2012, rock debris by September 2012), thereby restoring natural river flow along with sediment and wood transport through the former Lake Aldwell. Glines Canyon Dam removal is continuing with natural sediment erosion processes occurring in the former Lake Mills. The removal of Glines Canyon Dam is expected to be complete by 2013, but will depend on sediment erosion in the former Lake Mills.</p>
				<p>In addition to dam removal, a number of smaller recovery actions are underway.  Restoration staff are taking action to protect and provide early recolonization of fish populations, developing guidelines for monitoring and adaptively managing fish restoration activities, control of noxious weeds near the reservoirs, and substantial revegetation of exposed reservoir bottoms. Specific examples of these activities include the relocation of approximately 100 bull trout from Lake Mills to the upper Elwha watershed to protect them from high turbidity associated with dam removal, the planting of thousands of native plants, construction of engineered logjams and removal of several floodplain levees in the lower river. </p>
				<p>Perhaps most exciting, the removal of Elwha Dam, has already yielded results. During 2012, at least six native adult steelhead successfully migrated past the old Elwha Dam and former Lake Aldwell area to spawn in tributaries upstream. These fish represent the first natural colonizers of the Elwha River above Elwha Dam in 100 years! Approximately 200 Chinook redds (nests with eggs) and several pink salmon were also in areas upstream of the former Elwha Dam site during the fall of 2012. The river’s nearshore restoration has also begun. Severely eroded and sediment-starved beaches along the river mouth and Freshwater Bay are building rapidly, providing potential forage fish spawning habitat where there has been none for decades. </p>
<p>
				<h3>Financial and Human Resources</h3>
				</p>
				<p>Dam removal and ecosystem monitoring is being funded by a variety of federal, state, tribal, and local organizations including: The National Park Service, Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe, National Marine Fisheries Service, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Restoration Center, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, U.S. Geological Survey, Environmental Protection Agency, Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, Coastal Watershed Institute, Washington Department of Natural Resource, Washington Sea Grant, University of Washington, Peninsula College, and several others.</p>
				<p>The federal and state agencies and Tribe meet periodically to coordinate efforts. In addition, larger annual meetings have been held to provide summaries of past, current, and future activities to inform the local community and allow scientists, managers, and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) to coordinate their activities to stretch financial and human resources as far as possible. For example, the Elwha River Science Symposium was held in 2011 and 2012, and the Elwha Nearshore Consortium has met annually for the last seven years (8th planned for February 2013).</p>
<p>
				<h3>Restoring Natural Habitats and Processes</h3>
				</p>
				<p>For nearly one hundred years, the Elwha dams have prevented sediment and wood from being transported downstream to the lower river, estuary and nearshore marine environment. This resulted in approximately 34 million cubic yards (±4 million cubic yards) of sediment being trapped behind the two dams, preventing the material from being transported downstream to the lower river, estuary, and nearshore environment. In addition, smaller sized substrate has been scoured out of the lower river and nearshore, leaving only large substrate, which has reduced the quality of salmon and trout and forage fish spawning habitat. </p>
				<p>In addition to providing anadromous fish access to the upper river, dam removal will also return a more natural sediment and large wood transport regime, restore the natural channel-forming processes and historical thermal regime, and reinvigorate nutrient cycling in the lower river, estuary and nearshore environments. Restoring these important habitat-forming processes will revive and maintain these systems that have been degrading since dam construction 100 years ago.</p>
				<p>The two dams also eliminated the delivery of nutrients, in the form of salmon carcasses, to the upper watershed. It has been estimated that nearly 1,000,000 pounds of natural fish-based fertilizer and nutrients were delivered to the ecosystem each year before the dams were built. The reservoirs functioned as &ldquo;heat sinks&rdquo;, dramatically increasing summer water temperatures downstream of the dams. Temperatures in some years exceeded salmon tolerance levels. In those years, many fish were infected by disease or parasites resulting in high levels of pre-spawning mortality.   </p>
				<p>The Elwha River estuary and the adjacent marine nearshore have also degraded as a result of the lack of sediment transport in this system and associated management activities taken to prevent beach and bluff erosion. The restoration of sediment transport will improve river, estuary, and nearshore habitat quality.</p>
				<p>In preparation for dam removal, the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe has been doing extensive habitat restoration in the lower Elwha River. The Tribe is the lead for revegetation activities surrounding Lake Aldwell, an area that is culturally important to the Tribe, while Olympic National Park is leading the Lake Mills revegetation effort. This work will continue during the summer of 2013. In-stream habitat restoration includes the installation of engineered logjams, removal of historic, non-functioning floodplain levees, control of non-native vegetation and planting of native trees and shrubs. These actions are expected to &lsquo;prepare&rsquo; the lower river for the large volumes of sediment released by the dam removal project. As of January 2013, several reaches in the lower river have sediment fill in areas between rocks on the river bottom. In addition, sediment layers up to 2-3 feet thick have also accumulated on some river banks.</p>
				<p><em>Engineered Logjams</em></p>
				<p>The recovery of wood transport processes will also help restore the Elwha ecosystem. Wood is an important component influencing river dynamics and fish habitat in the Pacific Northwest. Logjams created by wood protect riparian habitat, develop floodplain channels, provide surfaces for algae and invertebrates to live, and provide fish rearing and holding habitat. Thus, the restoration of wood transport in the lower river will result in improved habitat conditions that have been met in the recent past by habitat restoration efforts.</p>
				<p>A total of 33 engineered logjams were built from 2002 through 2011, with an additional 20 engineered logjams planned for construction through 2013. The purpose of these engineered logjams is to provide rearing habitat for juvenile salmon and steelhead and holding and spawning habitat for adult salmon and steelhead. These structures will also help maintain channel stability following dam removal, as the large quantities of sediment released following dam removal move downstream. This channel stability will be critical for maintaining rearing, holding, spawning, and migratory corridors for salmon and steelhead. The Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe has also removed 2,000 ft. of floodplain levees and dikes in the lower river. </p>
				<p><em>Revegetation </em></p>
				<p>The restoration of natural riparian and upland vegetation and revegetation of the newly exposed lake beds has been an ongoing process that will help to stabilize sediments, reduce the spread of exotic invasive plants, and decrease erosion and its associated water quality impacts.</p>
				<p>Removal of the two Elwha dams will eliminate the reservoirs they created and expose large amounts of bare soil and substrate. Without revegetation, these exposed soils could provide a long-term source of fine sediment to the Elwha ecosystem, if they are allowed to continually erode. These areas are being actively revegetated to help stabilize exposed soils and limit the ability of exotic invasive plants from taking hold. Invasive plants are also being controlled through their direct removal, which reduces the threat of future invasions.</p>
				<p>The former reservoir bottoms are being revegetated both naturally and through a large replanting and seeding program led by the National Park Service and the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe. Invasive and exotic plant control as well as the cone, seed, and plant-cutting collection have been conducted throughout the Elwha watershed by Olympic National Park, Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe, and volunteers. Plants have been propagated at the Matt Albright Native Plant Center - Olympic National Park&rsquo;s greenhouse facility. </p>
				<p>Initial efforts by Olympic National Park staff and volunteers between the fall of 2011 and the spring of 2012 resulted in over 30,000 seedlings being planted at the former reservoir sites. Native plantings will continue well into the future with more than 400,000 native plants being planted in these areas before the project is completed. These plants will include Douglas fir, grand fir, western red cedar, western hemlock, black cottonwood, big leaf maple, bitter cherry, crabapple, ocean spray, red osier dogwood, salmonberry, snowberry, thimbleberry, willow and others. </p>
				<h3>Restoring Salmon</h3>
				<p>Although the Elwha River habitat above Lake Mills (formed behind Glines Canyon Dam) is pristine, it has been altered—salmon or steelhead had not spawned in the upper watershed since the dams were built. The full restoration of Elwha River salmon and steelhead is a challenging task that relies on numerous tools, including hatchery production as well as assisted and natural colonization. </p>
				<p>Important restoration actions include removing adult salmon from sediment-laden river water and moving them to clean water areas upstream of the Elwha Dam site or using them as brood stock for hatchery programs. These actions are intended to protect ESA listed species from the high-suspended sediment levels that are expected to be lethal to fish during and shortly after dam removal. </p>
				<p>Fully restoring Elwha River salmon, steelhead, and other key fish species will also put back an essential but often overlooked benefit of salmon: their carcasses. Restoring salmon and other fish species will increase the productivity of plants and wildlife throughout the watershed. Salmon and steelhead eggs, juveniles, and the carcasses that remain after fish spawn and die are an important part of Pacific Northwest river food webs. Salmon bring nutrients from the ocean when they return to spawn. These nutrients are used by hundreds of terrestrial and aquatic animals, and by riparian vegetation.</p>
				<p><em>Role of Hatcheries</em></p>
				<p>Because of the high suspended-sediment loads that are expected to occur for three to five years after dam removal, hatcheries are an important component of the Elwha salmon and steelhead restoration plan. The potential for lethal levels of suspended sediment during certain flow conditions raised concerns that fish populations could be negatively impacted (even extirpated) during dam removal. To alleviate this risk, particularly for ESA listed fish species, it was deemed necessary to bring fish into the existing hatcheries. </p>
				<p>The current plan is for hatcheries to be used during the initial protection and re-colonization phases of restoration, which are then expected to be replaced by natural production as fish populations rebuild. This includes collecting adult fish as brood stock to seed supportive breeding programs operated by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) and the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe. The programs are designed to help preserve five species of anadromous salmon and steelhead in the river through the dam removal period when lower watershed conditions will be inhospitable for natural-origin fish production, and assist in their recovery to a healthier status as recolonization of newly accessible habitat is accelerated. </p>
				<p><em>Assisted and Natural Colonization </em></p>
				<p>Assisted colonization includes the transportation of adult salmon and steelhead to habitats above the dams (but outside Olympic National Park) in hopes that these fish would spawn in the wild and help recolonize the river in the future. </p>
				<p>Before the removal of Elwha Dam, more than 600 adult coho salmon collected at the weir and Lower Elwha Tribe&rsquo;s hatchery to locations were moved upstream of the dam during the fall of 2011. These fish were moved to the mainstem Elwha, Little River, and Indian Creek during the fall of 2011. Many of these fish spawned in the Little River and Indian Creek, two of the lowest major tributaries in the Elwha River system. Juveniles have been observed in these areas, evidence that the spawning of transported adults was successful in producing natural-origin juvenile salmon.</p>
				<p>In the spring 2012, scientists from the cooperating organizations began transporting wild steelhead collected at the weir and Lower Elwha Tribe&rsquo;s hatchery to locations above Elwha dam. Over 60 wild steelhead from the turbid lower river were moved to the Little River and Indian Creek, which were not impacted by high turbidities associated with dam removal. The hope was that these fish would spawn in the wild and help recolonize the river in the future. Many of the relocated fish were observed spawning in the relocation areas.</p>
				<p>In addition to fish which were relocated, a handful of natural-origin adult steelhead successfully migrated past the former Elwha Dam site and former Lake Aldwell to spawn in tributaries upstream in 2012. The following summer, a few adventurous pink salmon and as many as 500 Chinook salmon found their way upstream past the former Elwha Dam site and former Lake Aldwell. Restoration activities, along with natural colonization by wild steelhead, pink and Chinook salmon into the river above the former Elwha Dam site, resulted in spawning in areas that have not been used by salmon in over 100 years.</p>
				<p>In the near term, natural colonization and the relocation of adult salmon will be used to populate the Elwha watershed. Future restoration activities will rely on the colonization of the newly accessible habitats by natural-origin adults. Natural colonization is the unassisted movement of adult salmon and steelhead above the former dams. Preliminary monitoring findings suggest that several natural-origin adult steelhead successfully migrated past the old Elwha Dam and former Lake Aldwell area to spawn in tributaries upstream in 2012.</p>
