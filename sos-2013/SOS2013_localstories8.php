				<h3>Conserving the Lifeblood of Puget Sound
						<br />
We Cannot Restore the Sound Without an Accurate Stream Inventory				</h3>
				<p>The challenges facing Puget Sound reach beyond its deep inlets and sinuous shorelines, all the way to the crests of the Cascades and Olympics, and into the rivers and streams that are the Sound&rsquo;s lifeblood. The streams that flow into Puget Sound form an integral part of its physical, biological, and chemical integrity. When those streams are inadequately protected, the consequences affect Puget Sound as surely as water flows downhill.	</p>
				<p>	State and local government agencies in Washington are charged with protecting Puget Sound&rsquo;s streams from negative impacts caused by adjacent land-use activities. In many cases that charge hasn&rsquo;t been met for a surprisingly simple reason: agencies have been relying on inaccurate maps.	</p>
					<p>	In Washington, the responsible agencies depend on a process called water typing to identify and categorize streams, lakes, and wetlands based on their importance, both ecologically and for human uses. This basic inventory is the most fundamental step in conserving the health of Puget Sound and its tributaries. Water typing answers the question: &ldquo;Where are the streams, and where are the fish habitats within them?&rdquo; Unfortunately, current water typing records and maps often underestimate the actual miles of fish-bearing waters by 50% or more. 	<p class="floatleft"><img src="images/SOS_2013_typing1.jpg" width="430" height="348" /></p>
					<p>	WFC has documented widespread error throughout Puget Sound in designating streams as fish-bearing or non fish-bearing. WFC has found that a significant number of streams in Puget Sound do not even appear on any maps. Hundreds of miles of productive Puget Sound watersheds are threatened because, when they are misidentified or unidentified on regulatory maps, they are often subjected to inappropriate land-use practices. Many streams are not receiving protection they warrant under already existing regulations. <u><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLB518AA2C0A4B1E9A&amp;feature=player_embedded&amp;v=VKrZfRQWTqY">Click here</a></u> to watch a video about the importance of accurate water typing. 	</p>
					<p>	Unless the watersheds draining into Puget Sound are accurately identified and protected, cumulative effects from the development of these watersheds will continue to contribute to the compromised health of Puget Sound. And until systematic inventories are performed, regulatory maps updated, and streams adequately protected, progress towards a healthy Puget Sound will continue to be significantly offset by the pervasive and in many cases unrecorded loss of freshwater habitat and water quality.
</p>
		<h3>HOW WATER TYPING WORKS, AND DOESN&rsquo;T</h3>
					<p>	Cities and counties in Washington are required to designate &ldquo;critical areas&rdquo; and develop regulations to protect them through the implementation of Critical Areas Ordinances (CAOs). Critical areas include important fish and wildlife habitat areas, wetlands, and aquifer recharge areas. To identify streams that warrant protection as critical areas, most CAOs refer to the water type maps produced by the Washington Department of Natural Resources (WDNR).	</p>
						<p>In 1975, WDNR developed the process of water typing to regulate forest practices that impact Washington&rsquo;s surface waters, classifying streams into types depending on their physical, biological, and human-use characteristics. Stream reaches that can support fish are classified as Type F, and non fish-bearing streams are classified as Type N. Accurate water typing is essential to protecting fish and their habitats because the type and proximity of human activities allowable in areas adjacent to streams and other surface waters is dictated by water type. For example, streamsidebuffer zones required on Type F streams are larger than those required on Type N streams.  In some cases, Type N streams receive no protection at all.	</p>
						<p>Studies, including work performed by WFC, WDNR, and several Native American tribes, have demonstrated that WDNR&rsquo;s original water typing efforts significantly underestimated the actual miles of fish-bearing streams in western Washington. 	</p>
						<p>Since 1997, WDNR has maintained a system for correcting water type designations in forestlands, but there is no comparable system to ensure timely updates in non-forestry areas subject to Growth Management Act planning and regulations. Likewise, county and local planning and conservation ordinances often rely on WDNR watertype maps, usually without adequate mechanisms for checking or correcting the data presented in the maps.	</p>
						<p>As part of its Habitat Lost &amp; Found program, WFC has been physically surveying streams throughout Washington to correct their misclassification and qualify them for the protection warranted under existing laws. With funding by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, WFC assessed water type in a randomized subsample of watersheds between the Canadian Border and the Columbia River. Since then, WFC has corrected the watertype classification of over 7000 stream reaches statewide using the state-sanctioned water-type survey protocol.

		<h3>A CRISIS IN REGULATING DEVELOPMENT</h3>
						<p>Though originally designed for defining stream buffer requirements for forest practices, the WDNR water typing regulatory maps have been widely adopted by city and county government agencies for regulating development activities outside the forest-practice zones. Recent Wild Fish Conservancy watertyping surveys in rural and suburban landscapes in King, Snohomish, Jefferson, Thurston, Mason, San Juan, Kitsap, and Island counties documented significanterrors in the regulatory maps.  Many stream reaches identified on the regulatory maps as Type N were found to support fish, and many streamsdid not even appear on the maps.  Surveying 380 square miles of Puget lowlands Wild Fish Conservancy documented 884 Puget Sound stream miles where WDNR had identified just 764 miles.  	</p>
		<h3>CASE IN POINT: Snyder Cove Creek </h3>
					<p>	Consider Snyder Cove Creek. A small watershed located on Cooper Point in west Olympia, Snyder Cove Creek flows directly into Eld Inlet in South Puget Sound. Prior to a Wild Fish Conservancy survey, the regulatory water type maps identified 0.2 miles of stream channel where Wild Fish Conservancy documented 1.4 miles—a 600% increase in stream length.  The regulatory mapidentified only 14% of the actual stream network. Unfortunately, the inaccurate stream channel mapping and the underestimated extent of fish habitat exhibited in Snyder Cove Creek regulatory map is not anomalous. Without watertype assessments to correct the inaccurate regulatory maps, watersheds like Snyder Cove Creek are not likely to be afforded adequate protection – protection they warrant under existing regulations.	</p>
		<h3>ACCURATE WATERTYPES ARE ESSENTIAL FOR PUGET SOUND</h3>
						<p>When misclassified and mismapped, Puget Sound lowland streams in areas within and bordering significant urban and suburban development are not protected from the negative impacts associated with development. The results are devastating for the streams, the fish that live in them, and the integrity of the Puget Sound nearshore habitats they feed.	</p>
						<p>When development occurs too close to streams, watersheds suffer significant alterations to their natural hydrographs—fall and winter stormflows increase in magnitude and frequency while summer baseflows reduce or disappear altogether. When streamside trees, plants, and grasses are removed or encroached upon, water temperatures are artificially elevated. Bank erosion, aggravated by the removal of riparian vegetation and the altered hydrograph, can cause dramatic channel downcutting that unravels stream channels and mobilizes large amounts of fine sediments. Increased impervious areas accumulate and deliver automotive, household, and industrial pollutants, channeling them into streams through stormwater infrastructure. Septic drainfields built too close to streams result in septage (partially treated waste) leaching into the stream, with subsequent ecological and human health concerns. Ultimately, sediment- and contaminant-laden stormwater is delivered to our nearshore habitats during the fall and winter, and lower water volume with higher temperatures are delivered to our nearshore habitats during the summer.	</p><p>
						These threats heighten the importance of cleaning up Puget Sound, and prominent among the immediate actions needed to reverse the input of toxic contaminants into Puget Sound is the control and reduction of stormwater runoff from urban and agricultural sources. This will require establishing and maintaining adequate riparian buffers on all streams and rivers within Puget Sound, effective stormwater management, and vigorous enforcement of existing laws whose purpose it is to maintain adequate buffers. But before any of that can happen, we need an accurate inventory of the region&rsquo;s freshwater resources—accurate regulatory water type maps.</p><p>
						In October 2006, fourteen of the region&rsquo;s most respected aquatic ecologists, geomorphologists, fisheries biologists, and professional engineers submitted an open letter to Governor Gregoire&rsquo;s Puget Sound Partnership in response to the Partnership&rsquo;s preliminary action recommendations to recover Puget Sound. The authors suggested that &ldquo;end of pipe&rdquo; stormwater management, status quo in the Puget lowlands, is inadequate to protect streams and Puget Sound. The authors conclude that saving Puget Sound will require, among other things, widespread and immediate actions including: preserving existing least-disturbed watersheds, preserving forest cover in the Puget Sound basin, eliminating runoff from impervious surfaces, preserving existing and restoring destroyed riparian habitats, and reducing the amount of existing impervious area.</p><p>
						Correcting inaccurate water-type maps will help provide land-use decision agencies with the fundamental information they need for responsible protection of our watersheds.</p>
				<h3>THE GMA – AN OPPORTUNITY</h3>
				<p>		All cities and counties in Washington are required to adopt critical areas regulations by the Growth Management Act (GMA). The GMA was amended in 1995 to require counties and cities to use the best available science in developing policies and development regulations to protect the functions and values of critical areas. With deadlines that vary across the state, all jurisdictions are required to review, evaluate, and, if necessary, revise their Critical Areas Ordinances to ensure that they meet GMA requirements. Given the demonstrable inaccuracies in the regulatory watertype maps that drive buffer width requirements in these local jurisdictions, it is reasonable to expect at a minimum that CAO updates will include watertype assessments and the creation of accurate fish and fish-habitat distribution maps. Unfortunately, with a few exceptions to date, systematic watertype assessments are not being included in local government CAO updates.</p><p>
						So long as land-use decisions continue to be made while relying on inaccurate maps, the continued investment of hundreds of millions of Puget Sound recovery dollars into nearshore protection and restoration actions won&rsquo;t alone be enough to recover the Sound. We will not be able to end, or even significantly slow, the pervasive loss of habitat and water quality in Puget Sound until systematic watertype inventories are performed, regulatory maps updated, and critical areas adequately protected. We will not recover Puget Sound without protecting and recovering the watersheds that feed it, and we cannot do that without a thorough and accurate inventory of those watersheds.</p>
