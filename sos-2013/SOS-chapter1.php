						<h4>KEY POINTS</h4>
						

					<div> <div id="SOS_rellinks">
							<ul>
									<li>The Performance Management Program provides the necessary course corrections as we follow the map set by the Action Agenda.</li>
									<li>One year into the 2012 Action Agenda, 
											68 percent of Near Term Actions are on plan or complete. The remainder are either off plan, under serious constraints and might not be accomplished, not started, 
											or unreported.</li>
									<li>Strategic Initiatives — our most critical and complex actions — have been a successful tool in focusing partner collaboration in Puget Sound.</li>
							</ul>
<h4>ACCOMPLISHMENTS</h4>
						

					<ul>
							<li>The Leadership Council is becoming more focused on implementing Near Term Actions. </li>
							<li> The Leadership Council conducts regularly scheduled Report Card forums. These forums address meaningful and effective problem solving and sharing of best practices.</li>
							<li>89 percent of the Near Term Actions under the Shellfish Strategic Initiative are underway, and 2,888 net acres of shellfish beds have been re-opened from 2007 to 2013.</li>
					</ul>
					 <h4>CHALLENGES</h4>
						<ul>
								<li>How do we know if our actions have made a difference? So many variables can affect this complex ecosystem that it is hard to say that one particular action is making a difference in the health of Puget Sound. </li>
								<li>Barriers to implementation include: limited funding and staff resources, insufficient effectiveness data, public misperception of the severity of the problem, regulatory loopholes and permit barriers, impacts from changing climate, and the unpopularity of tough decisions.</li>
						</ul>

						Tracking the Action Agenda</div>
						<p>Restoring the health of Puget Sound by 2020 is an ambitious goal. Its success depends not just on the dedication and hard work of our many talented partners, but also on constant monitoring, objective assessment, and continuous improvement.</p>
						<p>
								Puget Sound Partnership and its partners committed to 199 specific actions in the 2012 Action Agenda. Called Near Term Actions (NTAs), they provide the direction needed to reach our 2020 Vital Sign recovery goals. Intended to fast-forward our efforts to recover Puget Sound, NTAs include on-the-ground implementation, law and regulation changes, education and outreach programs, and research commitments.</p>
						<p>By tracking our progress on implementing the Action Agenda, as well as our investments and the ecosystem outcomes, we are able to better manage recovery and to provide course corrections to ensure that we arrive at the right destination — a healthy ecosystem — at the end of our journey.e.</p>
