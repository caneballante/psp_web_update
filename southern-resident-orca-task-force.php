					</div>
				<p>Intensified efforts to protect southern resident orcas are underway. On March 14, Gov. Jay Inslee announced an <a href="https://www.governor.wa.gov/sites/default/files/exe_order/eo_18-02_1.pdf">executive order</a> directing immediate statewide action to benefit southern resident orcas. Puget Sound&rsquo;s southern resident orca population numbers at just 76 animals, the fewest in more than three decades. This alarming decline signals that the southern resident population is in severe jeopardy and at risk of extinction if no action is taken. </p>
				<p>The governor&rsquo;s executive order outlines several short and long term actions designed to address major risks to orcas, including the lack of Chinook salmon, vessel traffic that produce excessive noise and disrupt the orca&rsquo;s feeding efforts, toxic pollutants that can contribute to their poor health, and instructs state agencies to take immediate steps to identify long-term solutions that will help recover both salmon and orca. The order also establishes a task force to coordinate with British Columbia, Oregon, California, Idaho, and Alaska in developing policy recommendations at the regional, state, and federal levels. The Governor has asked the Puget Sound Partnership and Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife to team up in leading support for the Task Force, with assistance from the Office of Financial Management and the Governor&rsquo;s Policy Office. At the Governor&rsquo;s request, Stephanie Solien, vice chair of the Puget Sound Partnership Leadership Council, will co-chair the task force, along with Les Purce, former president of Evergreen State College.</p>
				<p>The Partnership&rsquo;s technical and policy expertise aligns with the Task Force directives included in the Executive Order, which address, among other things, salmon recovery and removing toxins from the marine environment. Healthy salmon runs are a critical component of orca health. The Partnership&rsquo;s Leadership Council serves as the regional organization directed in state statute to plan and guide salmon recovery in Puget Sound. The Partnership also has long recognized polluted stormwater runoff as a major source of contamination to the marine environment and a threat to orcas. Partnership staff routinely advocate for projects and policies that will reduce such pollution. In addition, Partnership staff are involved in oil spill prevention efforts throughout Puget Sound. Oil spills are also considered major threats to orcas. With collective support from the governor and Washington state agencies, saving orca and salmon from extinction is a number one priority.</p>
