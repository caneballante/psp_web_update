The project worked with a network of tribal and state smolt trap operators to identify shared trends in Chinook salmon abundance and productivity metrics through time across 11 rivers throughout the Puget Sound region. Results from this project indicate that Puget Sound Chinook salmon retain signs of resilience, both in terms of asynchronous survival trends among populations and recent periods of increased survival for some populations. In a changing climate, salmon recovery can further bolster resilience by fostering life history diversity and adopting management strategies robust to periods of both high and low survival. Additionally, this project showed the value of a cohesive network of juvenile salmonid monitoring in the region for informing recovery efforts.
