			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>The Puget Sound Partnership (Partnership) funds projects every biennium that address priority monitoring information needs to inform and accelerate the recovery of Puget Sound. Projects are funded via a formal project solicitation process. Priority is given to projects that support the <strong>objectives</strong> of the <a href="https://pspwa.box.com/s/64eyrsgbvey7psyxcvwc4t6xhcr1gyq2">Puget Sound Ecosystem Monitoring Program (PSEMP) Strategic Plan</a> to <strong>increase collaboration, support adaptive management, and improve communication.</strong> </p>
			
			<p>Successful projects also address cross-cutting principles of <strong>integrating biophysical and social sciences, justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion (JEDI), and climate change.</strong></p>

					<td>Fundamental Environmental Contextual Metrics Dashboard</td>
						<td><p>Climate change poses a serious threat to Puget Sound recovery efforts. To adapt recovery efforts to these changes, we need metrics that show why change is occurring.

When finished, the metrics will be available to the public via a web-based dashboard that will concisely summarize current conditions.

					<td>Avian Habitat Suitability Models for Puget Sound Estuary Birds</td>
						<td><p>Puget Sound and the Salish Sea support hemispherically significant concentrations of shorebirds, waterfowl, and other marine bird species. Despite this importance, birds have received little attention by state and federal recovery efforts. This project develops science products that support the management needs of estuary birds, including end-user stakeholder engagement, avian-habitat suitability models, and the initiation of a regional avian monitoring framework for river delta estuaries. A monitoring framework will facilitate targeted data collection that allows for avian conservation planning and management at local and regional scales and supports integration of birds in estuary recovery efforts. This project produced an <a href="https://pspwa.box.com/v/AvHabModSummary">executive summary</a> and <a href="https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/3ceca87f5e544265aee6d516ee95aec9">storymap.</a> You can find a <a href="https://pspwa.box.com/s/9suop9ggo6h08v630vf90oum5cyj5kgm">video overview here</a>.</p></td>

We must prioritize limited funding to address the chemicals of greatest concern and for future regulatory requirements.

						<td>Juvenile Salmonid Monitoring in Large Puget Sound Rivers</td>
					<td><p>Juvenile salmonid monitoring is a critical component of understanding both freshwater productivity and marine survival. The project worked with a network of tribal and state smolt trap operators to identify shared trends in Chinook salmon abundance and productivity metrics through time across 11 rivers throughout the Puget Sound region. Results from this project indicate that Puget Sound Chinook salmon retain signs of resilience, both in terms of asynchronous survival trends among populations and recent periods of increased survival for some populations. In a changing climate, salmon recovery can further bolster resilience by fostering life history diversity and adopting management strategies robust to periods of both high and low survival. Additionally, this project showed the value of a cohesive network of juvenile salmonid monitoring in the region for informing recovery efforts. The project will also derive some preliminary information from data collected across the network. The project has developed a <a href="https://pspwa.box.com/s/05nom10gpsm1pzsut4ur9rvg31fvm764">one-page overview</a> and <a href="https://pspwa.box.com/s/9wp044gr0346subxe8yqxko26njskire">report</a>.
